### Masternode Operator Governance Question

##### Summary
* This proposal is a simple **governace question** (no scope of work proposed). 
* The question seeks guidance regarding **treasury scaling**.  Details in later sections.
* I'm asking for **5 DASH** for fee reimbursement.

##### Question
Do masternode owners want to fund more cooperatives for treasury scaling?

##### Possible Answers
Later sections give context for the "problem" and "solution".

###### Yes
* I see the problem;  I generally agree with the proposed solution
* I want to encourage more teams (co-ops) to submit proposals

###### No
* I see the problem, but I'm opposed to the proposed solution
* I don't see the problem; nothing needs to be solved

###### Abstain
* I have considered the information, but I don't have an opinion
* I am not strongly in favor or opposed
* I don't like the way the question is phrased

##### Background & Motivation
The treasury fund is large and growing.  Recent price and popularity increases have led to new growing pains.  There are questions about how the treasury can adapt to these scaling issues.

There are several ways to accommodate scaling.  Some ways are healthier than others over the long term.  My opinion is that we should seek to **decentralize the treasury payouts**.  Previous forum discussions have made it clear that there are varying opinions about what decentralization *is*, and what *causes* it.  The following section describes my understanding of the matter.  I further explain my recommendation and justify the claim that it would be decentralizing.

###### Recommendation & Justification
Consider the following figure showing three types of networks:
[Figure]

The treasury can be modeled as a network, where dots are people receiving funds that originated from the treasury, and lines connecting dots are a transfer of treasury funds.  **Currently, our treasury most resembles the centralized model.  Moving right in the figure above would be a *decentralizing* effect**.  I'm proposing that we move in that direction by funding more groups of people who employ other people.  These organizations would be autonomous and voluntary, much like cooperatives.  Some might consider these to be similar to distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs).  **Funding cooperatives would yield the benefits of both centralizaed and ditributed networks**.  It's a healthy balance between the two.  

Decentrialized systems are:

* simple & efficient
* robust & sustainable
* conservative (safe) & progressive (innovative)

Long-time Dash participants with reputations can organize various flavors of cooperatives. These co-ops would welcome new-comers and help them develop reputations in the community.  This lowers the barrier for compensated participation, increasing development of the Dash ecosystem with fresh, innovative approaches from new-comers under the guidance of experienced long-timers. These cooperatives would offer greater financial privacy to contractors compared to contracting with the treasury itself.  Privacy could also extend to management and development of the cooperative's services.

A decentralized tresury would maximize accountability and minimize hierarchy.  Responsibility for deliverables would rest on several SPOCs (single points of contact), each co-op having one person responsible for communicating with the community.  Groups would be small enough to manage effectively, as opposed to one very large group and/or hundreds or thousands of independant contractors.

Additionally, a decentralized treasury structure would generally increase quality and decrease cost over time, because some cooperatives would compete with others offering the same services.  Lastly, this structure would decrease the burden on MNOs and Dash contractors.  MNOs would have relatively fewer proposals to evaluate, and contractors would have a lower barrier to entry. 

###### Further Justification
Mastenode operators (MNOs) need to direct more funds (in fiat terms) as price increases.  The number of MNOs will level off, but price will likely not.  This puts each MNO in charge of more funds over time.

* If average proposal size remains steady, more proposals will need evaluating.
* If number of proposals remains steady, the cost of each proposal must rise.  

Either way it looks like more work for MNOs.  One way to keep work load low is to entrust more and more funds to individuals who have established reputations.  This is a centralizing effect, and we've seen this play out.

Proposal fees (in fiat terms) are high.  This increases the financial risk for would-be treasury contractors.  Because treasury funds are released before work is completed, MNOs are reluctant to give funds to new-comers with no reputation.  This too leads to MNOs entrusting funds to individuals who have established reputations, leading to centralization.  

If this trend continues we will continue to see centralizaton in treasury payouts, discouraging new-comers from contributing to Dash.  This will be detrimental to Dash's growth potential and price.  

Masternode voting has declined over time, indicating voter burnout.  Masternode operators have indicated that they do not want to lower the proposal fees.
